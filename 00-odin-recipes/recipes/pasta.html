<h1>How to Make Fresh Pasta</h1>
    
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> On a clean surface, make a mound of flour. Create a well in the center and add the eggs, salt, and olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Ingredients:</strong> Using a fork, beat the eggs gently and gradually incorporate the flour from the edges of the well until a dough begins to form.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Bring the dough together with your hands and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Divide the dough into smaller portions. Use a rolling pin or a pasta machine to roll it out to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut the Pasta:</strong> Cut the rolled-out dough into your desired shapes (e.g., tagliatelle, fettuccine, or lasagna sheets).</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Boil in salted water for about 2-4 minutes, or until al dente. Fresh pasta cooks faster than dried pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Drain and toss with your favorite sauce or ingredients. Enjoy!</li>
